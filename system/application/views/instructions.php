            <p>FreeLadder is simple to use. Get started in three steps:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Challenge someone ranked higher than you on the ladder.</li>
                <li>Contact your opponent and arrange the match.</li>
                <li>Click on the <button>I Won</button> or <button>I Lost</button>.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>That's it!  FreeLadder will update the ladder and your personal record. Read on for more detailed instructions.</p>
			<h2>Using FreeLadder</h2>

            <h3>Rankings</h3>
            <p>FreeLadder let's you easily participate in a competitive ladder. Ladders are popular in clubs of many disciplines: tennis, squash, ping-pong, chess, etc. A ladder is a ranking, not a rating.  Your ranking is determined by the matches you and others have played recently.  The rankings change on FreeLadder based on some simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the higher ranked player wins, the rankings don't change.</li>
<li>If the lower ranked player wins, they take the place of their opponent. The players in between (if there are any) will shift down one spot.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Important: rankings are updated when match is saved. In an active ladder, players are constantly moving up and down in rank at the same time others are placing challenges and completing matches. When both players agree on results, the match is final and the rankings are updated based on the ladder at that instant. </p> 


            <h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>You challenge a player ranked higher than you on the ladder. (How many rungs ahead depends on the ladder setup.)
<li>If you lose, the rankings are unchanged.
<li>If you win, you take your opponent's spot on the ladder. Your opponent and those below him move down one spot. 
</ul> 
<h2>Using FreeLadder</h2>
<ol>
<li><bold>If you are "Active", you are active.</bold>  If your status (set in User Profile) is set to "Active" for a given ladder, then you are saying to everyone that you're accepting challenges and ready to play.  If you don't want to play or won't be around, set your status to "Inactive".
<li><bold>Challenges aren't cancelled.</bold> Once you challenge someone or have been challenge, there is no "undo". You are expected to play the match and record the result. If for some reason you can't complete the match, then you should Forfeit. 
<li><bold>Results are simply win/lose.</bold>  FreeLadder only cares who won/lost a match.  You will not be asked for individual game scores, and it is up to you (or your club) to decide what a match consists of to determine a winner (e.g. best of 5, first person to 100, etc.)
<li><bold>Agree on results.</bold>  the results mechanism on freeladder is pretty simple: you enter whether you won or lost, and if you're opponent enters the opposite then the match is saved.  if you do not agree (i.e. you both say you won or lost), then you will prompted to either change your answer or wait for your opponent to.  like challenges, there is no cancelling of the completed match. it is expected that both sides will come to an agreed upon result.
<li><bold>The match is final when it's saved.</bold>  in an active ladder, players are constantly moving up and down in ranking and the same time other are placing challenges and completing matches.  the rule for determining the new rankings is: when both players agree on results, the match is final and the rankings are updated based on the ladder at that instant.  you might have challenged someone 3 spots ahead of you and beat them, but if before your results were in they fell below you (or you jumped ahead of them due to another match), then the positions won't change.  
</ol> 
With an understandng of the these basics, you'll have no trouble using FreeLadder.

<p>Unless a modified set of match rules is agreed to by both players, the following will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matches will be best 2 out of 3 games.</li>
<li>Games will be played to 11 points and the winner must win by 2 points.</li>
<li>Serve will change sides every two points.</li>
<li>If the score reaches "deuce" (i.e. tied at least 10-10), serve will change sides after every point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The games themselves will follow standard <a id="usatt" href="http://www.usatt.org/rules/index.shtml">USATT rules</a>. A few of the basic rules to follow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertically toss (neither drop nor toss sideways) the ball over 6 inches from the center of your flat palm before you serve.</li>
<li>The serve needs to start from behind the endline.</li>
<!--<li>A missed serve (whether or not the bat contacts the ball) is a point for the other side.</li>-->
</ul>
